# You can specify the storage type Mackup will use to store your configuration
# files.
# For now you have 3 options: "dropbox", "google_drive" and "file_system".
# If none is specified, Mackup will try to use the default: "dropbox".
# With the "dropbox" storage engine, Mackup will automatically figure out your
# Dropbox folder.

# If you want to specify another directory, you can use the "file_system"
# engine and Mackup won't try to detect any path for you: it will store your
# files where you explicitly told him to, using the "path" setting.
# The "path" can be absolute (from the / of your drive) or relative to your
# home directory.
# The "path" setting is mandatory when using the "file_system" engine.
# Note: you don't need to escape spaces or wrap the path in quotes.

# You can customize the directory name in which Mackup stores your file. By
# default, if not specified, Mackup creates a "Mackup" directory in the storage
# engine you chose, e.g. "~/Dropbox/Mackup".
